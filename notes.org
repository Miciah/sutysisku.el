* TODO Implement actions for Helm
Currently the Ivy search supports copying the word, gloss, definition or all
three to the clipboard. Helm needs this too!

* TODO Make setting controlling whether Ivy or Helm is used
Instead of having two distinct commands, a simple setting should be provided
that specifies whether Ivy or Helm is used.

* TODO Local file-cache
Right now the wordlist JSON is only kept in memory. Probably best to cache this
to a local file so that subsequent startups are quick. The fetch command can
simply be invoked to redownload the file for updates.
